# Changelog

## v.0.0.9 - beta for v.0.1.0

### ðŸš€ Added

- Configuration management (and a configuration to manage)

- The ability to silence restart messages when enabling/disabling (#issue13)

- The option to return to where we left off when restarting (#issue13). Not perfect, but we will return to your book if you were reading when enabled, or the filemanager if you were in the filemanager. Any other state is ignored and just uses the default restart settings.

### ðŸ©¹ Fixes

- Correctly call the ui function to disable SSH if it's running when we start

### TODO still

- Update readme from scratch

## v.0.0.4 - QoL update (2025.06.14)

- Remove unnecessary visual of a checkbox

- Added sample user patch for displaying airplane mode status in the reader footer

- If SSH is in our disable list, make sure the process n is stopped. Otherwise it will be running and you can't stop it unless you kill it in terminal. And it blocks USB from launching.

- Info message for feedback when a gesture is used

- May have finally locked down networking on kindles. Tests on paperwhite are now consistantly up

## v0.0.3 (2025.05.26)

### ðŸš€ Added

- Gesture support

### ðŸ©¹ Fixes

- Finally figured out enable/disble wifi so it works on different devices correctly. Tested on Clara and Kindle, plugin settings reverted correctly, wifi reconnected correctly, and wireless settings are not lost

- Changed how we set and reset the disabled plugins list in the main settings.reader.lua. We were not always re-enabling plugins if they appeared in our own airplane module list.

- Fixed how the wifi settings are re-enabled when exiting

- Restore wifi state to the same state it was when AirPlane started - off or on

- Fixed deleting all temporary plugin disables before restoring

## v0.0.2 (2025.05.22)

### ðŸš€ Added

- No additions today.

### ðŸ©¹ Fixes

- Replaced how we reference files from `rootpath` to the function for
  `DataStorage:getDataDir` - I suspect this was causing some of the issues on
  non-kobo devices (ie, worked on kobo does not mean it works everywhere)
- Removed a block from the original release that was causing the list of files
  to be considered part of AirPlane Mode to include anything already disabled
  - which also meant when exiting AirPlane Mode, it was erasing those entries
    from the settings files

- Removed a block that was setting a variable, replacing the value, resetting it, but never actually _using_ it

## v0.0.1 (2025.05.21)

### ðŸš€ Added

- Clicking AirPlane Mode now opens a menu where you can choose between
  enable/disabe and editing which plugins are included as disabled

- Generate a default file of plugins on first use - this is only generated if
  there is no list file

- Added menu of all installed plugins on your device with the option of adding
  any of them to the disabe list when AirPlane mode is enabled

- Added paperplane icons to indicate status

- Documentation updated!

### ðŸ©¹ Fixes

- cleaned up all of the commented code and debug statements :-)

## v0.0.1-alpha (2025.05.06)

- Initial testing release

### ðŸš€ Added

- Everything

### ðŸ©¹ Fixes

- Existential nihilism
